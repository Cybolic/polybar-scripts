# Script: battery-cyberpower

A shell script that shows the battery status for CyberPower UPS devices.

This script is able to display power supply changes in real time.

It requires access to run pwrstat as root, so you may need to adjust your system to allow this.

Optionally, you can also show the current load and estimated time the battery will last by passing `--show-estimation` to the script.

## Dependencies

Install pwrstat from CyberPower's website.

## Module

```ini
[module/battery-cyberpower]
type = custom/script
exec = ~/polybar-scripts/battery-cyberpower.sh
;exec = ~/polybar-scripts/battery-cyberpower.sh --show-estimation
tail = true
```
